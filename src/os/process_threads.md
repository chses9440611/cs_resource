        - Process resource needs (memory: code, static storage, stack, heap, and also file descriptors, i/o)
        - Thread resource needs (shares above (minus stack) with other threads in the same process but each has its own pc, stack counter, registers, and stack)
        - Forking is really copy on write (read-only) until the new process writes to memory, then it does a full copy.
        - Context switching
            - How context switching is initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware?
