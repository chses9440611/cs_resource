        - BFS notes:
           - level order (BFS, using queue)
           - time complexity: O(n)
           - space complexity: best: O(1), worst: O(n/2)=O(n)
        - DFS notes:
            - time complexity: O(n)
            - space complexity:
                best: O(log n) - avg. height of tree
                worst: O(n)
            - inorder (DFS: left, self, right)
            - postorder (DFS: left, right, self)
            - preorder (DFS: self, left, right)
